# Warhammer fixed-memory damage calculator core

[Use the hosted calculator](https://amrishhallberg.com/warhammercalculator/)

This implementation is C17, performs no dynamic allocation, and keeps all
large scratch storage in a caller-owned `struct calculator_workspace`.

## Authorship and AI disclosure

The base C calculator code is written and owned by the repository owner. The
website and supporting project scaffolding were generated and refined with AI
assistance. This is an unofficial fan-made utility and is not affiliated with
or endorsed by Games Workshop.

## Why there are two distribution types

`struct distribution` stores exact integer outcome counts. It is ideal for
small dice expressions such as `2D6+3`, but repeated attack probabilities make
exact denominators grow exponentially and eventually overflow `uint64_t`.

`struct probability_distribution` stores Q31 fixed-point probability mass:

```text
0.0  -> 0
1.0  -> 2^31
```

The full combat distribution uses Q31 integers, not `float` or `double`.
Quartiles therefore remain fixed-memory and fast. The public
`calculate_attack_expected_damage()` function separately calculates the mean
as an exact reduced fraction.

## Fixed memory

With `MAX_DISTRIBUTION_RESULT == 1024`, the calculator workspace is about
49 KiB on a typical 64-bit build. Allocate it once and reuse it:

```c
static struct calculator_workspace workspace;
```

Do not put a new workspace inside a deeply recursive function.

## Basic usage

```c
#include "warhammercalculator/calculator.h"

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(void)
{
    struct weapon_profile weapon = {0};
    struct target_profile target = {0};
    struct calculator_workspace workspace;
    struct distribution_summary summary;

    strcpy(weapon.name, "Example weapon");
    weapon.attacks = (struct dice_value){ .modifier = 4 };
    weapon.hits_on = 3;
    weapon.strength = 8;
    weapon.ap = 2;
    weapon.damage = (struct dice_value){
        .dice_count = 1,
        .dice_sides = 6,
        .modifier = 1
    };
    weapon.critical_hits_on = 6;

    strcpy(target.name, "Example target");
    target.toughness = 8;
    target.save = 3;
    target.invulnerable_save = 5;
    target.feel_no_pain = 0;
    target.wounds = 12;
    target.reduction = 0;

    rule_add_lethal_hits(&weapon.rules);
    rule_add_twin_linked(&weapon.rules);

    if (!calculate_attack_damage_summary(
            &weapon,
            &target,
            &workspace,
            &summary)) {
        return 1;
    }

    printf("min: %u\n", summary.minimum);
    printf("Q1: %u\n", summary.first_quartile);
    printf("median: %u\n", summary.median);
    printf("Q3: %u\n", summary.third_quartile);
    printf("max: %u\n", summary.maximum);
    printf("mean: %llu/%llu\n",
        (unsigned long long)summary.mean.numerator,
        (unsigned long long)summary.mean.denominator);

    return 0;
}
```

## Built-in rules

The current convenience functions are:

```c
rule_add_lethal_hits(&weapon.rules);
rule_add_devastating_wounds(&weapon.rules);
rule_add_twin_linked(&weapon.rules);
rule_add_reroll_failed_hits(&weapon.rules);
rule_add_sustained_hits(&weapon.rules, 1);
rule_add_torrent(&weapon.rules);
rule_add_wound_bonus(&weapon.rules, 1);
rule_add_cover(&target.rules);
rule_add_wounds_on(&weapon.rules, 4);
rule_add_critical_wounds_on(&weapon.rules, 4);
```

The devastating-wounds convenience rule currently compiles to "critical
wounds bypass the save." Edition-specific wording can be isolated by changing
that one rule compiler rather than rewriting the probability engine.

## Why the rules are fast

A rule callback is not invoked for every hit, wound, or save path. Each rule is
called once by `attack_plan_build()`. It modifies a compact `struct
attack_plan` containing thresholds, bit flags, and reroll face masks. The hot
loops use only that compiled plan.

This gives the extensibility of plugins without putting a function-pointer
call into every innermost dice loop.

## Adding a custom compile-time rule

A plugin receives a fixed-size payload and changes the attack plan once:

```c
static bool compile_damage_floor(
    struct attack_plan *plan,
    const struct weapon_profile *weapon,
    const struct target_profile *target,
    const union rule_payload *payload
) {
    (void)weapon;
    (void)target;

    if (plan == NULL || payload == NULL) {
        return false;
    }

    plan->damage_floor = payload->u16[0];
    return true;
}
```

Register it without allocating memory:

```c
union rule_payload payload = {0};
payload.u16[0] = 0;

rule_set_add(&weapon.rules, compile_damage_floor, payload);
```

For a rule that transforms each possible damage result, a compiler can call
`attack_plan_add_damage_transform()`. Those transforms run once per distinct
damage outcome, not once per complete hit/wound/save path.

## Build and test with CMake

```sh
cmake --preset native-debug
cmake --build --preset native-debug
ctest --preset native-debug
```

The supplied Makefile is also supported:

```sh
make test
```

The included tests cover exact dice distributions, quartiles, ordinary attack
resolution, random attacks/damage, Feel No Pain, and several compiled rules.

## WebAssembly build

Activate an Emscripten SDK environment, then run:

```sh
emcmake cmake -S . -B build/wasm -G Ninja -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF
cmake --build build/wasm
```

This produces `calculator.js` and `calculator.wasm` in `build/wasm/`.

## Current boundaries

- AP is stored as a nonnegative magnitude.
- One reroll is modeled; rerolled dice are not rerolled again.
- Total damage outcomes above `MAX_DISTRIBUTION_RESULT` are rejected rather
  than silently truncated.
- Damage reduction uses a default floor of 1 for positive damage. A custom rule
  can change the floor.
- The distribution reports uncapped inflicted damage. Capping at a target's
  remaining wounds, model-by-model spill rules, and damage spill are not
  silently approximated.

## 10th edition profile database

The generated SQLite database at `data/warhammer_10e.sqlite` contains attacker,
weapon, and target profiles sourced from Wahapedia's structured 10th-edition
exports. See `data/README.md` for the schema overview and rebuild command.
